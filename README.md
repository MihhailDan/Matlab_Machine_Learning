This repository represents my home assignments regarding Machine Learning course. All three of them were done in MatLab. 
At each folder You can find .pdf file that has my personal report.

Right now I am doing one real-data project to reveal unobvious patterns and create a predictive model for Spotify playlist. I just really like music.
This will be uploaded here later.
